# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information:
# Start with version information of ‘0:0:0’ for each libtool library.
# Update the version information only immediately before a public release of your software. 
# More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger faster.
# If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).
# If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
# If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then increment age.
# If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then set age to 0.
