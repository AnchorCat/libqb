What is libqb?
--------------
libqb is a library with the primary purpose of providing high performance
client server reusable features. It provides high performance logging,
tracing, ipc, and poll.
We don't intend be an all encompassing library, but instead provide very
specially focused APIs that are highly tuned for maximum performance for client/server applications.

For more info look at:
- Our wiki: http://libqb.org

  You can build it yourself with the following commands:
  $ make doxygen
  $ firefox ./doc/html/index.html
